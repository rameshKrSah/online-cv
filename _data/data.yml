    summary: |
      Hello, I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Washington State University. My research focus is on learning from limited data in embedded sensor systems. Specifically, I am trying to traing state-of-the-art machine learning models for healthcare applications using time-series data with problems such as class imbalance, noisy labels, and small datasets.

        - Studied and analyzed the effects of adversarial examples in embedded systems. Machine learning models used in embedded systems were found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples and we also developed a framework for creating adversarial examples using time-series sensor data used in wearable sensor systems. We published a conference paper, [Adar: Adversarial Activity Recognition in Wearables](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8942124/), with our approach, analysis, and results.

        - Explored transferability of adversarial examples and transfer learning problems in wearable sensor systems. We published a paper that explores the transferability of adversarial examples in wearable systems by taking human activity recognition systems as an example. We found interesting results and more about this work can be found in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07982)

        - Quantified, measured, and detected stress in real-time in alcohol-addicted individuals using timeseries physiological sensor data. We aim to build a mobile health system that can detect stress and provide interventions such as music therapy, games, and inspirational texts to prevent alcoholdependent people from relapsing.

        Trained machine learning models for the ototoxicity classification of molecules. Trained models were able to achieve good results but suffered from a lack of data and class imbalance problems.

        - Compressed and accelerated machine learning models for embedded devices and smartphones.

        - Researched Binarized Neural Networks(BNNs) and consolidated findings by developing a library to train binary neural networks from scratch.

        - Trained binary CNN for classification using time-series inertial sensor data and binary image classification and object detection models. Binary models did not suffer from significant performance drop but at the same time showed major improvements in terms of memory and computation speed.

        - Developed the inference pipeline of binary models for ARM-32, ARM-64 embedded platforms, and Android devices.

    - role: Firmware Design Engineer
      time: 2016, Aug - 2018, May
      company: Real Time Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Nepal
      details: |
        - Developed a prototype system to detect earthquakes using an off-the-shelf accelerometer. The system was designed to detect P and S waves and act as an earthquake monitoring and early-warning system. (Internship)

        - Designed and developed products for smart home devices, IoT, queue management systems, weather monitoring systems, and communication systems for remote research systems.

        During this, I worked with ARM Cortex-M, Cortex-A, ESP8266, and ESP-32 microcontrollers and used communication protocols like MQTT, LoRa, ZigBee, HTTP
